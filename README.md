## Overview  
This project implements a simple Python-based menu ordering system. It allows customers to select items from a menu, specify quantities, and view a detailed receipt including the total cost. The script is designed to be easily extended and customized for various use cases.

## Project Details  
The system is designed to simulate an ordering experience in a food-related environment. Users are presented with a menu, prompted to make selections, and asked to specify quantities. The order is stored in a structured list, and a formatted receipt is generated at the end of the session.

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code or any preferred IDE.
4. Install any necessary Python packages (though this project does not rely on external libraries).

## Usage  
1. Run the `menu.py` script.
2. Follow the prompts to select items and specify quantities.
3. After completing the order, a detailed receipt will be displayed.

### Running the Script
- **Visual Studio Code:** Open the script in VS Code, ensure the correct Python interpreter is selected, and run the script using the integrated terminal or the run button.
- **Command Line:** Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and execute the script using `python menu.py`.

## Features  
- Interactive menu system.
- Input validation for both menu selection and quantity.
- Dynamic receipt generation with aligned formatting.
- Extendable structure to add more items or categories.

## Acknowledgments
